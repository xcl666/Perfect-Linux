Now imagine that: I get a server hardware.

1, I install the Debian GNU/Linux on it.
	How to install the os?
	a, Use the usb to book.
	b, It is best without X now.
	c, And don't forget to install openssh-server to let you connect it.

2, I will install software on it to make the environment fit me well.
	openssh-server
	sources.list
	nfs-common
	vim
	sudo
	tmux
	git
	wget
	zsh 
	oh-my-zsh (sh -c "$(wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)")
	w3m

	If you need X.
	i3
	xfce4-terminal
	sakura
	chromium

3, I should install some server software now.
	vsftpd
	apache2
	webalizer
